hey there it is my second program!
this time its on C.
nothing much to tell about it as it is pretty evident that it's a number type converter
i have applied some basic conversion algorithms i have learned recently. 
if you want to check individual algorithm ,i used. you can check them in resources.
i have also made a converter which covers all type of converters i made in a single program.
it is essentially a frankestein code made by piecing together individual programs so it might not be much informative but i have tried my best to keep it clean and readable.
there are few shortcoming such as not reading floats and -ve for more types.
maybe i will update it in future(who knows?)
